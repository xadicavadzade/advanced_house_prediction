# House Price Prediction with Stacking Ensemble


A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts house prices using advanced ensemble methods, achieving superior performance through stacking techniques.


# Project Overview


This project implements a sophisticated house price prediction system using stacking ensemble methods, combining multiple machine learning algorithms to achieve optimal prediction accuracy.


Key Achievement: Improved model performance from R² = 0.88 (single XGBoost) to R² = 0.90 (Stacking Ensemble)


# Technical Architecture


Ensemble Composition


The stacking model combines multiple base estimators:



Gradient Boosting Regressor (500 estimators, learning_rate=0.05)


LightGBM Regressor (1500 estimators, learning_rate=0.03)


Ridge Regression (Meta-learner, alpha=1.0)



# Feature Engineering Pipeline

Neighborhood Price Mapping: Median price encoding for categorical neighborhoods


Ordinal Feature Encoding: Smart mapping for quality and condition features


Missing Value Imputation: Strategic handling of numerical and categorical features


Log Transformation: Applied to target variable (SalePrice) for better distribution
